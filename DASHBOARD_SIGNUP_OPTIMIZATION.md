*Status: âœ… COMPLETE - All requested optimizations implemented*

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive optimizations made to the Paradox Engine platform focusing on the dashboard signup page, homepage transitions, author presentation, and navigation consistency.

## âœ… Major Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Signup Page Redesign ðŸš€

**Primary Focus: Google OAuth Authentication**
- **Removed Credential-Based Login:** Eliminated all username/password authentication options
- **Enhanced Google OAuth:** Made Google sign-in the primary authentication method with prominent styling

**Updated Authentication Flow:**
```
User arrives at /signup
    â†“
Primary Option: "Sign in with Google" (prominent)
    â†“
Secondary Option: Quick email signup (streamlined)
    â†“
Both redirect to /dashboard upon success
```

**Security Enhancements:**

  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1, rotateY: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 1, delay: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }}
  ```

- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Book responds to user interaction with subtle 3D rotation
  ```javascript
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05, rotateY: -5 }}
  ```
