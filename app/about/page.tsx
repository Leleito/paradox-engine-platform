              <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-800 mb-6">
                Thomas Njeru is the Co-founder and CEO of Pula, an agricultural technology company 
                protecting over 16 million smallholder farmers across Africa and Asia through innovative 
                insurance solutions. A former Director at Deloitte, Thomas made a bold career transition 
                at 28 from the corporate consulting world to entrepreneurship.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-800 mb-6">
                Driven by his childhood connection to agriculture and a vision for meaningful impact, 
                Thomas uniquely combines technical expertise in actuarial science with deep understanding 
                of agricultural challenges. With 10+ years in the insurance industry, he co-founded Pula 
                with Rose Goslinga after raising $2 million in initial funding.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-800 mb-6">
                Under his leadership, Pula has become a leading agri-tech company, demonstrating how 
                calculated risk-taking and purpose-driven decisions can create transformative impact. 
                His journey embodies the principle that extraordinary outcomes emerge not from avoiding 
                life's contradictions, but from learning to harness them as fuel for transformation.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-800 mb-6">
                "The Paradox Engine" draws from Thomas's own experience wrestling with the paradox of 
                safety versus purpose, ultimately choosing to build something meaningful while managing 
                entrepreneurial risks. The framework helps individuals navigate life's contradictions 
                and turn tension into momentum for growth.

                  With a background in actuarial science and over 10 years in the insurance industry, 
                  Thomas built expertise in risk assessment, financial modeling, and corporate strategy. 
                  His time as a Director at Deloitte provided deep insights into how large systems operate 
                  and the power of data-driven decision making.

                <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-700">
                  Growing up with a childhood connection to agriculture, Thomas understood the vulnerabilities 
                  faced by smallholder farmers. This personal understanding would later become the foundation 
                  for Pula's mission to protect millions of farmers across Africa and Asia.

                <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-700 mb-6">
                  At 28, Thomas faced the classic paradox: the security of corporate success versus the 
                  uncertainty of entrepreneurial purpose. Choosing to leave Deloitte's safety net, he 
                  co-founded Pula with Rose Goslinga after raising $2 million in initial funding.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-burgundy-800 mb-4">Calculated Risk-Taking</h3>
                <p className="text-prose text-burgundy-700">
                  Thomas embodies the principle of using expertise to manage uncertainty rather than 
                  avoid it. His actuarial background provides the tools to assess risk, while his 
                  entrepreneurial spirit drives him to take meaningful action despite uncertainty.
